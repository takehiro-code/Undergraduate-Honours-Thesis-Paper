\ProvidesPackage{review}[2020/05/18 Commands to help with reviewing]

% This package helps in reviewing between two people. Example:
%
% Euclid once said that 2 + 2 = 5.
% Advisor says: \unresolved{Are you sure that 2 + 2 = 5?}
% Student says: \reply{Oh right! I think it's 2 + 2 = 4.}
%
% Once done, you can mark as resolved:
% \resolved{Are you sure that 2 + 2 = 5?}
%
% To enable reviewing, insert this at the bottom of your preamble.tex:
% \enablereview
