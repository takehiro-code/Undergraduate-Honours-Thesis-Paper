\section{Standard Deviation of Averaged Result}
\label{sec:appendix/section_b}

We showed the averaged result of 12 video samples in Chapter \ref{sec:results/section_a}. Due to the lack of video samples and each video has a different resolution, frame rate, number of objects, and object classes, each performance result is different, and the standard deviations are large. Since little insight can be derived, we show the standard deviation table in this section.
