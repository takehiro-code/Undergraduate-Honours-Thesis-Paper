\section{One-sided t-test for "person" object class}
\label{sec:appendix/section_t_test_0}

In Chapter \ref{subsec:/results/section_a/t_test}, we showed the result of one-sided t-test for "all" object classes across all the video sequences. In this appendix section, we include the result for "person" object class across all video sequences. Although the QP at which the score is greater or less than that of the uncompressed case is different, the similar conclusions to "all" object classes can be made in "person" object class. The result shows, for example, the MOTA score at QP = 34 is lower than the score at the uncompressed sequences with 95\% confidence. Similar to "all" object classes, the metrics Precision and PT shows the result that is not expected according to Chapter \ref{sec:background/section_e}. The value less than the significance level of 0.05 is bolded in the table.
