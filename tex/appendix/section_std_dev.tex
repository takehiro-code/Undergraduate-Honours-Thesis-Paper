\section{Standard Deviation of Average Result}
\label{sec:appendix/section_std_dev}

We showed the averaged result of 12 video samples in Chapter \ref{sec:results/section_a}. Due to the relatively small number of video samples and each video has a different resolution, frame rate, number of objects, and object classes, each performance result is different. Therefore, the standard deviations are large. We show the standard deviation table in this section.
