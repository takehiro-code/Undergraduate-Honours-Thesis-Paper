\section{Justification of SORT Optimization}
\label{sec:appendix/section_a}

We optimized SORT by maximizing MOTA on the training video sequence of PartyScene as explained in Section \ref{sec:methods/section_b}. Since MOTA is not the only metric in MOT metrics, we will justify that other scores will achieve good performance at max age of 1, min hits of 5, and IOU threshold of 0.4. Table \ref{tab:optimizing_tracker_table} shows the results of all the performance metrics at different min hits. Note that we fixed max age of 1 as suggested by \cite{abewley_abewleysort_2021} and IOU threshold of 0.4 based on MOTA result.
