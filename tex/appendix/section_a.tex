\section{Justification of SORT Optimization}
\label{sec:appendix/section_a}

We optimized SORT based on maximizing MOTA on the training video sequence of Class C PartyScene as explained in Chapter \ref{sec:methods/section_b}. Since MOTA is not the only metric in MOT metrics, we will justify that SORT with YOLOv3 will achieve a good performance at max age of 1, min hits of 5, and IOU threshold of 0.4. Table \ref{tab:optimizing_tracker_table} shows the results of all the performance metrics at different min hits. Note that we fixed max age of 1 as suggested by \cite{abewley_abewleysort_2021} and IOU threshold of 0.4 based on the MOTA result.
