\section{Regression Analysis of All Metrics}
\label{sec:appendix/section_regression_all}
As we focused on the analysis of the MOTA score, we showed its result in Section \ref{subsec:/results/section_a/regression_analysis}. In this appendix section, the regression analysis result for all the metrics are included in Table \ref{tab:regression_all}. The regression analysis is applied on all the raw data points for "all" object classes across all the video sequences. The equivalent transformations of QP and each performance score, and the hypotheses can be established. The value less than the significance level of 0.05 is bolded in the table.
