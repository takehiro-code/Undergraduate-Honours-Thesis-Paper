\section{Correlation of Performance Metrics}
\label{sec:appendix/section_c}

We examined the video sequences with each performance metric and some metrics indeed consists of other performance metrics according to the definitions listed in Chapter \ref{sec:background/section_d}. We did not explicitly describe which metrics correlate or relate to other metrics but included the following figure, the potentially useful information to reveal the correlation between different performance metrics. Figure \ref{fig:correlation} shows the heatmap of correlation between different metrics.
