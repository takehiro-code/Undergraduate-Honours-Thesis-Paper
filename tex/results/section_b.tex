\section{Case Study of Individual Sequences}
\label{sec:results/section_b}

In this section, we will look into the individual sequences to support the averaged result obtained in the earlier section. Out of 12 video samples, we observed the two categories of different results as we named Category I and Category II. For the first category, the result is consistent with the hypothesis on different QP such that most performance scores decrease as QP increases while showing the lower performances than the uncompressed sequences. However, for the second category, the performance scores increase but starts decreasing at high QP, and the performance for the compressed sequences outperform the uncompressed ones before the high QP. We observed that the first category of result is observed in most of the video sequences except Class B Cactus, Class D BlowingBubbles, Class E FourPeople, and Class E KristenAndSara which are observed in the other category. We will examine the Class D BasketballPass, Class E Johnny, Class D BlowingBubbles, Class B Cactus as cases studies. Instead of tracking all of the object classes, we limit the tracking on the Person class to analyze the difference between the two categories. The Person class is "cleaner" in result than other classes because the Person object class is more continuously present across the frames while other object classes such as Sports ball and Handbag are more discontinuous in frames. Not only Person class, we included the Potted plant object class in Class B Cactus.


\subsection{Class D BasketballPass}
We examined the result from the individual video sequence of Class D BasketballPass. This sequence consists of 7 Person objects and the occlusion occurs frequently in the video.  Figure \ref{fig:BasketballPass_0_multiplots_qp} shows all the performance score on different QP at MSR = 16 from the video and Table \ref{tab:BasketballPass_0} shows each numerical value. We selected MSR = 16 out of different MSR values since different MSR did not make a significant difference from the regression analysis in the previous section.
\input{tex/figures/BasketballPass_0_multiplots_qp}
\input{tex/tables/BasketballPass_0}
The result is consistent with the averaged result shown in Chapter \ref{sec:results/section_a} such that the performance decreases as QP increases on most of the metrics except IDP and MOTP. To examine the result more thoroughly, we inspected the video sequence in frame by frame at different QP.
\input{tex/figures/BasketballPass_0_frame320}
The figure \ref{fig:BasketballPass_0_frame320} shows comparison of ground truth, tracking results without compression, and with compression at different QP in the Class D BasketballPass sequence at frame 320. This comparison reveals that the higher the QP, the image quality decreases. As the quality decreases, the YOLOv3 detector starts failing to detect the Person objects, and hence we confirmed that FN increases. We also confirmed that IDs decreases because the number of detected objects decreases, therefore the number of times the objects being occluded decreases. When occlusions decreases, ID switch on the trajectories should decrease. For the FP, we were not able to observe and conclude the reasoning why FP increases at high QP from the Class D BasketballPass sequence alone. From FN, FP, and IDs, the increase of FN is significantly larger than the decrease of IDs and FP, so we concluded that MOTA will decrease as QP increases based on the equation \ref{eqn:MOTA}. From the Figure \ref{fig:BasketballPass_0_multiplots_qp}, we observed that IDP increases. As we confirmed that the number of occlusions decreases as QP increases, we can verify that IDFP will decrease. Hence, based on the IDP equation \ref{eqn:IDP}, due to the drop of IDFP, IDP increases. This result can also be explained qualitatively that as QP increases, occlusions occurs less, so the incorrect ID assignments occurs less, which makes ID precision higher at a higher QP. For the MOTP, we were are not able to conclude the reasoning of the increase of MOTP up to QP = 30.

\subsection{Class E Johnny}
Class E Johnny sequence consists of 9 Person objects. The occlusion was not observed, and the objects scarcely move. Figure \ref{fig:Johnny_0_multiplots_qp} shows the visualization of all the performance metrics at different QP, and Table \ref{tab:Johnny_0} shows the corresponding numerical values. 
\input{tex/figures/Johnny_0_multiplots_qp}
\input{tex/tables/Johnny_0}
This result reveals that the most performance metrics decrease as QP increases similar to the case from the Class D BasketballPass. The decrease of performance can be verified from the Figure \ref{fig:Johnny_0_frame400} such that the objects are starting to not be detected.
\input{tex/figures/Johnny_0_frame400}
The decrease of detections proves the increase of FN. ID switch did not occur in the uncompressed sequence but was observed in the higher QP in the video sequence. Therefore, there is an increase of IDs at the higher QP. The increase of IDs can be explained qualitatively that since there is no occlusion in this sequence, ID switch between the trajectories does not occur at the lower QP but starts to occur at the high QP as the image quality drops and the detector detects the wrong target, leading to the ID switch. Based on all the increase of FP, FN, IDs, the general tracking performance metric of MOTA decreases as QP increases. Note that occlusion does not necessary correlate with the number of IDs since IDs is counted whenever a different identity is assigned to the target after re-identification (re-ID). In this sequence, the image quality drops and the detection becomes more discontinuous and re-ID is attempted but different ID is assigned to the target, thereby IDs increases as QP increases. Since IDs increases, we expect IDP to decrease. This is because the more ID switch to occur, we expect the ID precision to be lower and indeed IDR also decreases. Therefore, we confirmed that ID performance drops as QP increases. We also observed that other metrics such as detection performance and track quality drops as QP increases. The result in this sequence is different from the result of Class D BasketballPass such that the occlusion does not occur and hence ID precision decreases as image quality drops. 

\subsection{Class D BlowingBubbles}
We will now examine the sequence where we observed a decrease of general tracking performance of MOTA, which can be confirmed in the visualization from Figure \ref{fig:BlowingBubbles_0_multiplots_qp} and the numerical values from Table \ref{tab:BlowingBubbles_0}.
\input{tex/figures/BlowingBubbles_0_multiplots_qp}
\input{tex/tables/BlowingBubbles_0}
The MOTA visualization plot shows that the performance increases until QP = 38 but decreases thereafter. To verify this phenomenon, we inspected the video carefully by frame. From Figure \ref{fig:BlowingBubbles_0_frame465} that shows the sequence at frame 465, we observed a humanlike object that was detected as Person at the uncompressed case and QP = 18, 22, 26 but not thereafter.
\input{tex/figures/BlowingBubbles_0_frame465}
This reveals that the detector incorrectly detect and recognize this object as Person at the lower QP, but as the image quality drops at the higher QP, the detector starts to not detect this particular object. Note that this humanlike object is not a part of the ground truth. This phenomenon was also observed in other frames. This observation proves that as QP increases, FP decreases, leading to the increase of MOTA until QP = 38. After QP = 38, the image quality further drops and as can be confirmed from Figure \ref{fig:BlowingBubbles_0_frame465}, 1 Person object is not detected at QP = 46, thereby FN increases. We observed that not only MOTA, the detection performance and ID measure also result in the same way such that the performance scores increase up to the middle of QP range and decrease thereafter. For IDs, though there is no occlusion, we observed IDs to be increasing due to the drop of the image quality that makes the detection discontinuous. Note that we observed a decrease of IDs at the middle of QP range and it is because the detector starts to not detecting the false object as Person and re-ID attempt decreases.
