This chapter will show the results from the experiment and insights found from the analysis. In the previous chapter, we described that we run the experiment with the various settings of QP and MSR. After obtaining the results of tracking performance, we will analyze the numerical results with the aid of visualization while examining each image frame in the sequences.
