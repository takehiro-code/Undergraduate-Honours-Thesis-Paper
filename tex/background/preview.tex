% A short preview of this chapter.

In order to assess the multiple object tracking performance on compressed sequences, we have to build an object tracking system. Our objective in this thesis is not to build the best possible state-of-the-art object tracking system but to analyze the effect of video compression on tracking performance. Therefore, we have chosen a simple and effective object tracker design. YOLOv3 \cite{redmon_yolov3_2018} was chosen as an object detector and SORT \cite{bewley_simple_2016} was chosen as a tracking mechanism to perform data associations of object identities. Our object tracking system is in the category of detection-based online tracking with deterministic output. Due to the simplicity in design, this tracker does not solve the problems of long-term occlusions and object re-identifications.

In this chapter, we will be reviewing the background of YOLOv3, SORT, HEVC video compression standard, and MOT metrics for performance evaluation.
