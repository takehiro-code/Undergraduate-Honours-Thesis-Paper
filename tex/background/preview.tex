% A short preview of this chapter.

In order to assess the multiple object tracking performance on compressed sequences, we have to build the object tracking system. Our objective in this thesis is not to build the best possible state of the art object tracking system but our focus is to analyze the effect of video compression on the tracking performance. Therefore, we have chosen the simplest possible object tracker in design. YOLO v3 was chosen as an object detection component and SORT was chosen as a tracking component to perform data associations of the object identities. Our object tracking system is in the category of detection-based tracking and online tracking with deterministic output. Due to the simplicity in design, this tracker doesn't give the solutions to the problems of occlusions and object re-identifications. 

In this chapter, we will be reviewing the background of YOLO v3, SORT, video compression standard, and finally the MOT metrics that we use to assess the tracking performance.
