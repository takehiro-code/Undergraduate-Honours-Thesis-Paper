\section{Summary}
\label{sec:background/summary}

To summarize, we explained the background of the YOLOv3 object detector and SORT for multiple object tracking. We explained the HEVC codec and its configurations to be varied for the experiment. We also defined each metric that evaluates the object detection and tracking performance in the context of multiple object tracking. Finally, we stated the hypothesis for the detection and tracking performance on uncompressed and compressed sequences over different QP and MSR. To verify this hypothesis, we will conduct the experiment to take measurements of performance scores for each metric on different QP and MSR. The method of the experiment is explained in the following next Chapter.
