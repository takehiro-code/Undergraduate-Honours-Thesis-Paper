\section{Summary}
\label{sec:background/summary}

To summarize, in this chapter, we explained the background of the YOLOv3 object detector and SORT for multiple object tracking. We explained the basics of the HEVC codec and its configuration parameters to be varied for the experiment. We also defined several metrics that evaluate the object detection and tracking accuracy in the context of multiple object tracking. Finally, we stated the hypotheses for the detection and tracking accuracy on uncompressed and compressed sequences over different QP and MSR values. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct experiments to take measurements of accuracy scores for each metric on different QP and MSR values. The experiments are explained in the next chapter.
