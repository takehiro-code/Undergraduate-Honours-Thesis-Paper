\section{Summary}
\label{sec:background/summary}

To summarize, we explained a background of YOLOv3 object detector and SORT for multiple object tracking. We explained the HEVC codec and its configurations to be varied for the experiment. Finally, we showed each definition of metrics to assess the object detection and tracking performance in the context of multiple object tracking. Based on this background information, the next chapter will show the methodology for the experiment.
