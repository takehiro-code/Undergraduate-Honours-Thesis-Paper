\section{Hypothesis}
\label{sec:background/section_e}

We hypothesized that the object detection and tracking performance will be higher in uncompressed sequences than the compressed sequences. Applying lossy video compression to the uncompressed sequence will inevitably lose information, so we expect to see the performance to be higher for the uncompressed video. Also, the higher the QP, we expect to see a decrease in tracking performance since increasing QP will decrease bitrate and pixel rate. For the MSR, the lower the value, HEVC cannot cover the fast motion, so we expect to see a decrease in the tracking performance.
