\section{Hypothesis}
\label{sec:background/section_e}

We hypothesized that the object detection and tracking accuracy would be higher in uncompressed sequences than the compressed sequences. Applying lossy video compression to the uncompressed sequence will inevitably cause loss of information, so we expect to see the accuracy higher for the uncompressed video. Also, the higher the QP, we expect to see a decrease in tracking accuracy, since increasing QP will decrease bitrate and cause a larger loss of information. For MSR, the lower the value, HEVC is less able to cover fast motion, so we expect to see a decrease in the tracking performance.
