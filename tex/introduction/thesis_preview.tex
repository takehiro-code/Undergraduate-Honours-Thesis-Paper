We started by illustrating the motivation for this research and providing history and background information for each object tracking and video compression concept in Chapter \ref{chap:introduction}. We will explain the more detailed background information on the adopted methods in Chapter \ref{chap:background}. Chapter \ref{chap:methods} shows the methodologies and experimental procedures. Chapter \ref{chap:results} presents the results from the experiments and data analysis. Finally, we will conclude this thesis with the highlighted insights and future work in Chapter 5. The additional information is included in the Appendix.
