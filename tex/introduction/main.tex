Object detection is a computer vision task to recognize the object instances from digital images. Specifically, the goal of object detection is to detect the different object classes such as "person", "cup", and "clock". Object detection is a building block for various applications such as “smart vehicle”, that informs the driver if one is running in the right direction at a proper speed, or a system to detect pedestrians to prevent accidents \cite{gavrila_real-time_1999}. Object detection can further be developed to object tracking, which is another computer vision task. Object detection is able to detect the objects for different classes, but this task alone has no unique identification of objects within the same class in a sequence of frames. For example, the system can detect multiple persons, but there is no identification of each person across the frames, and hence object tracking is supposed to assign each unique identifier (ID) to each object instance.

Video compression is ubiquitous in most visual processing pipelines. Compression of video is necessary because it would be impractical to transmit it or save it in a storage device without compression. For example, 720x480 pixels of full-color 90 min video with 30 frames per second (fps) takes 167.96 GB uncompressed and is too large to transmit. Since video compression is ubiquitous, any video we access is pre-compressed, and this raises the question of how much video compression impacts the object tracking performance. To our knowledge, the effect of video compression on object tracking has not been studied in detail. Hence, this project aims to analyze the effect of video compression on object tracking performance by assessing the various metrics used for multiple object tracking.
