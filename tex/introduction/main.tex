Object detection is a computer vision task that can recognize the object instances from digital images. Specifically, the object detection task detects the different object classes such as "person", "cup", and "clock". Understanding object detection allows us to achieve various applications such as “smart vehicle”, the system that informs the driver if one is running in the right direction at a proper speed, or a system to detect pedestrians to prevent accidents utilizing real-time object detection \cite{gavrila_real-time_1999}. Object detection task can further be developed to object tracking, which is another computer vision task. Object detection task is able to detect the objects for different classes, but this task alone has no unique identification of objects within the same class in a sequence of image frames. For example, the system can detect multiple persons, but there is no identification of each person across the frames, and hence object tracking task will assign each unique ID to each object instance.

Video compression is ubiquitous in most visual processing pipelines. Compression in the video is necessary because it would be impractical to transmit the video and save it in the storage device without compression. For example, 720x480 pixels of full-color 90 min video with 30 frames per second (fps) has 167.96 GB from the group of \citeauthor{ponlatha_comparison_2013} \cite{ponlatha_comparison_2013} and is too huge in size to transmit. Since video compression is ubiquitous, any video we access is all pre-compressed, and this raises the question of how much video compression impacts the object tracking performance. To our knowledge, the effect of video compression on object tracking has not been studied in detail. Hence, this project aims to analyze the effect of video compression on object tracking performance by assessing the various metrics used for multiple object tracking.
