\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

It is a good idea to keep your tex files short.
This makes them easier to edit and navigate.
For example, I like to create my figures in separate tex files.
Then, you can easily insert them using the "input" command.
Insert a figure:

\input{tex/figures/sample_figure.tex}

\clearpage % force new page

Insert a figure containing a grid of subfigures:

\input{tex/figures/sample_figure_grid.tex}

% OPTIONAL: \FloatBarrier can be used to prevent figures from floating too far.
% Use this sparingly! Preferably only when you are doing a final revision.
\FloatBarrier

To cite a paper, you can do this~\cite{ioffe2015batch}.
To reference a figure, chapter, or section within your thesis, try
\cref{fig:sample_figure} or
\cref{chap:background} or
\cref{sec:methods/section_a}.

If you want to include sections within the chapter,
I recommend splitting them up into separate files,
and then using the "input" command to include them.
If you use Overleaf,
you can double click on any text in the PDF to jump to its latex code.

Here are a couple of sections:

\input{tex/introduction/section_a.tex}

\input{tex/introduction/section_b.tex}

\input{tex/introduction/thesis_preview.tex}
