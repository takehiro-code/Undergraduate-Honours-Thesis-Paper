\section{Summary}
\label{sec:methods/summary}

In this chapter, we described the 13 uncompressed video sequences with the prepared ground truth used to run the experiment. The object detection and tracking pipeline with YOLOv3 and SORT were described. In this pipeline, the data conversion from YOLO format to MOT format was explained. Before running the experiment, since there are 6 parameters needed to be set to run YOLOv3 and SORT, we tuned the parameters on the training sequence to optimize the detector and tracker and determined the suitable values for the parameters. Finally, we explained the experiment pipeline for taking measurements. The pipeline starts with encoding to generate bitstreams, decoding, color conversion, running YOLOv3 and SORT, and evaluating the detection and tracking performance.
