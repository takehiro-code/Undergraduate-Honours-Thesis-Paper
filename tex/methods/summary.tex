\section{Summary}
\label{sec:methods/summary}

In this chapter, we described the 13 uncompressed video sequences with the ground truth we generated to run the experiment. The object detection and tracking pipeline with YOLOv3 and SORT were described. The data conversion from the YOLO format to the MOT format was explained. Since there are 6 parameters to be set to run YOLOv3 and SORT, we tuned the parameters on the training sequence to optimize the detector and tracker and determined the suitable values for the parameters before running the main experiment on other sequences. Finally, we explained the experiment pipeline. The pipeline starts with encoding to generate bitstreams, decoding, color conversion, running YOLOv3 and SORT, and evaluating the detection and tracking performance.
