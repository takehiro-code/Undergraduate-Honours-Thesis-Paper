In this chapter, we will describe the dataset and experimental procedures employed to test our hypotheses. This thesis work started with preparing the ground truth data by annotating the objects in raw HEVC test sequences. We then set up the experiment by choosing suitable values of the parameters in the object tracking system. After the setup, we applied HEVC video compression to the uncompressed video sequences and ran the object tracking system with YOLOv3 and SORT to obtain the tracking results. We then compared the result with the ground truth to assess the tracking performance using MOT metrics.
