In this chapter, we will describe the dataset and procedure of the experiment and its implementation. This thesis work started with preparing the ground truth of raw video sequences by annotating the objects in the sequences. We then set up the experiment by choosing the suitable parameters of configurations in the object tracking system. After the setup, we apply HEVC video compression to the uncompressed video sequences and run the object tracking system with YOLOv3 and SORT to obtain the tracking results. We then compare the result with the ground truth to assess the tracking performance using MOT metrics.
