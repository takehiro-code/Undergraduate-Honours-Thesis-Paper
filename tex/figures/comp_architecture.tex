  The typical video compression architecture adapted from \cite{zhang_overview_2019}.
%   The encoder consists of predictive coding, transform coding, and entropy coding compresses the input video and generates the compressed bitstream. The decoder decompresses the bitstream in reverse order to the encoder and outputs the reconstructed video.
